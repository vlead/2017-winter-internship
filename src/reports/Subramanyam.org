* Introduction
  This report contains all work done in the span of =27-11-17= to =22-12-17= .

* Objectives
** Install Virtual Labs College Cloud Edition on machine
- Install Virtual Labs College Cloud Edition using the installation manual.
- Make a report on the installation manual suggesting improvements.

** Exploring =Onboarding=, =Literate-tools=, =Process Management= in =dev.vlabs.ac.in=
- Explore Onboarding and Literate-tools and process management in dev.vlabs.ac.in 
  repositories in VLEAD.

** Make a tutorial on =MergeSort= experiment of =DataStructures= lab
- Make a tutorial on MergeSort experiment.
- Explain in detail the subparts of MergeSort - split, merge.
- Add interactive exercises in the MergeSort experiment for the user.

** Demonstrate the time complexity of =MergeSort= experiment
- Derive the time complexity of MergeSort experiment.
- Give an example of MergeSort graph and find the number of computations for sorting.
- Prove the computation value is same as the value based on time complexity.
- Plot a graph of MergeSort time complexity.

* Project repositories
** Data-structures lab.
- The repository can be found [[https://gitlab.com/vxc-research/ds-lab][here]]
- The files are present in =master= branch.

* Outcome of Internship
** Installed Virtual Labs College Cloud Edition on my machine
- Installed Virtual Labs College Cloud Edition on our machine.
- Performed all the steps present in the instruction manual.
- Made a report on the instruction manual.

** Explored =Onboarding=, =Literate-tools= and =dev.vlabs.ac.in=
- Went through the repositories of onboarding, literate-tools, dev.vlabs.ac.in.
   
** Made a tutorial for =MergeSort= experiment
- Made a plan for the tutorial of =MergeSort= experiment.
- Implemented interactive exercises for =Merge= and =Split= subparts of =MergeSort= experiment.
- Implemented interactive exercises for =MergeSort= experiment.
- Explained the subparts =split= and =merge= of MergeSort experiment.

** Worked on the demonstration of time complexity of =MergeSort= experiment.
- Explained and computed the time complexity of =MergeSort= subparts =split= and =merge=.
- Showed that the complexity of =MergeSort= Algorithm is nlogn.
- Proved that the number of computations for some array using =MergeSort= Algorithm
  is same as the formula.
- Plotted the graph of =MergeSort= algorithm time complexity.
- Compared various sorting algorithms using time complexity graph.

* Conclusion
- I thank VLEAD for a wonderful experience again as an Intern.
- I have learned a lot in this intern period.
- I hope that I have contributed positively to the organization.
